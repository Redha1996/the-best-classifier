# the-best-classifier
This project was made under the Coursera Machine Learning course.

It uses IBM Watson Studio environment.

In this project, we have used 4 different classification techniques namely:
1. K-Nearest Neighbours.
2. Decision Tree.
3. SVM classification.
4. Logistic Regression.

These 4 techniques are applied on the same classification problem. And then we determine which technique is the most accurate for the given problem.

Accuracy is measured using methods like:
1. Jaccard similarity index.
2. Log loss.
3. F1-score.
